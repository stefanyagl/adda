/* We use some extensions from 2.2, if available. Namely MPI_C_BOOL and MPI_C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX. Those types may be
 * available in earlier implementations, but we actually use them only when implementation declares itself conforming to
 * MPI 2.2 (to avoid some subtle problems). For OpenMPI this is since version 1.7.3. If this version is found, it is
 * further required during runtime.
 *
 * While MPI 2.2 fully supports bool & complex datatypes (including reduce operations), there is lack of the support of
 * reduction on Windows. The most advanced implementation (for which binaries are available) is MPICH2 1.4.1p1 - it
 * doesn't support reduce on complex numbers, although the same Unix version does.
 * http://trac.mpich.org/projects/mpich/ticket/1525 . Moreover, MPICH2 1.5 and further can't even be compiled on
 * Windows. http://trac.mpich.org/projects/mpich/ticket/1557
 *
 * Thus, we use a special test of MPICH2 deficiency further on.
