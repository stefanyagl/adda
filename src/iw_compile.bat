@echo off
:: Compiles ADDA in seq mode using Intel compiler for Windows (which uses some of the tools from Visual Studio).
:: Note that Intel compilers behave very differently (in terms of options and predefined macros) on Windows than
:: on Linux/MacOS. Thus, this file is designed only for testing Intel compiler, but not for production compilation
:: in various modes. For the latter use the main Makefile with MinGW64 toolchain.

:: Copyright (C) ADDA contributors
:: GNU General Public License version 3
::
:: Tested with Intel Compilers 2021.2 (v.2021.1) on top of Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 (v.16.9.0) on Windows 10 x64
:: Both "Classic" and "oneAPI" (LLVM) compilers were tested
:: Visual Studio Build Tools were obtained from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
:: Intel C++ Compiler Classic and Intel Fortran Compiler Classic - from
:: https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/oneapi-standalone-components.html#inpage-nav-5-undefined
:: https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/oneapi-standalone-components.html#inpage-nav-8-1
:: The latter two packages also include oneAPI compilers.
::
:: To perform the compilation:
:: 1) Find and click "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019" in Windows Run menu
:: 2) (only once) Additionally set up FFTW, assuming you already downloaded it - see
::    https://github.com/adda-team/adda/wiki/InstallingFFTW3
::    a) Set the path to it below (fftw-path)
::    b) cd %fftw_path%   (into its directory)
::       C:   (change drive letter if needed)
::       lib /def:libfftw3-3.def
:: 3) Set environment for Intel compilers, by running
::    <Intel>\compiler\latest\env\vars.bat (<Intel> is the install directory)
:: 4) cd into the script directory (.../adda/src)
::    (for repeated use, you may combine steps 3 and into a batch file placed into a directory, where you start on step 1)
:: 5) Check other settings in this script below (compilation flags, use of Fortran, source files,...)
:: 6) Run this script
